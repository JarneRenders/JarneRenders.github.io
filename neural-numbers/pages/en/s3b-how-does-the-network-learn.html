  <p class="lead">A new neural network does not “know” anything at the beginning. It has to be “trained” first. For this purpose, the neural network is given <strong>training data</strong> as input. In our case, training data consists of images of handwritten digits which were manually identified by humans.</p>
  <p class="lead">The network receives individual training images as input. After each one, the parameters (i.e. <strong>bias</strong> and <strong>weights</strong>) are updated so that the output of the network changes in the direction of the desired result - and not just for the current training picture, but for all training data. By continuously adjusting the bias and weights, the network gradually “learns” and its output becomes more and more accurate.</p>
